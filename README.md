# ShowBot

The official artificial intelligence bot for the [Bob & Kevin Show](https://bobandkevin.show/).

# Why?

We needed an intern. No humans applied so we built one.

# What can it do?

It has a voice box (to talk), a voice recognizer (to listen to voice commands), it has a virtual body (a console app) and has learned one skill so far (it can search wikipedia and read it back).

# Can it do more?

Over time, we'll add more skills and human-like features. Please send a PR or simply open up suggestions as issues.

# Will it take over the world? If so, when?

Unclear. Our best guess is "sometime in the future" it might.

# Birthday
Official ShowBot birthday is May 18, 2019.
